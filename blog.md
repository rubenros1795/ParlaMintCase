## Introduction to the topic

Scientific knowledge and expertise stands at the center of recent government responses to the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Containment strategies, vaccination efforts and economic policies are informed and shaped by experts and scientists. The power of medical-scientific experts and institutions is, in the eyes of many, unprecedented. Especially after years of populist discontent in many democracies, the corona epidemic has produced a narrative of a "return of science". Science has regained its public trust and centrality in policy-making (Windholz 2020; Bertsou 2020). However, the opposite argument could also be true. Conspiracy theories flourish like never before (Shelton 2020; Duarte 2020). The suddenness of the pandemic’s spread and the gravity of the containment measures reinforced existing suspicions against scientific and political authorities and the spread of “fake news” pertaining to a “plandemic” has accelerated. It appears that the corona crisis has produced a heightened polarity between the technocratic adoption of scientific knowledge on the one hand and the conspiratory rejection of (institutionalized) scientific knowledge on the other. For democratic decision-making, this begs the question how to navigate between these poles. This question is relevant because it has proved hard to wage politics during the corona crisis (Amat et al. 2020; Bekker, Ivankovic, and Biermann 2020). Political opposition against government strategies has been obscured by a 'rally around the flag'-effect in the first months of the pandemic, and the spectre of conspiratory post-truth soon after.
