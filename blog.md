## Introduction to the topic

Scientific expertise stands at the center of recent government responses to the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Containment strategies, vaccination efforts and economic policies are informed and shaped by experts. Their decision- and policy-making power seems to be unprecedented. Especially after years of populist discontent in many democracies, the central position of experts in corona-ridden societies has produced a narrative of a "return of science". Science has regained its public trust and centrality in policy-making (Windholz 2020; Bertsou 2020). However, one could just as well argue the opposite. Conspiracy theories flourish like never before and scientific actors are attacked and threatened both verbally and physically (Shelton 2020; Duarte 2020). The suddenness of the pandemic’s spread and the gravity of the containment measures reinforced existing suspicions against scientific and political authorities and the spread of “fake news” pertaining to a “plandemic” has accelerated. 

It appears that the corona crisis has produced a heightened polarity between the technocratic adoption of scientific knowledge on the one hand and the conspiratory rejection of (institutionalized) scientific knowledge on the other. For democratic decision-making, this begs the question how to navigate between these poles and, moreover, how to complicate the binary choice between uncritical technocracy and populist distrust. This question is relevant because it has proved hard to wage politics during the corona crisis (Amat et al. 2020; Bekker, Ivankovic, and Biermann 2020). Political opposition against government strategies has been obscured by a 'rally around the flag'-effect in the first months of the pandemic, and the spectre of conspiratory post-truth soon after (Baekgaard et al., 2020; Louwerse et al. 2021).

This report discusses the findings of a case study that investigates the concomitant "return" of science and expertise in European democracies during the COVID-19 crisis. The case study is part of the ParlaMint project (Erjavec et al., 2021). Although ParlaMint collected debates from 17 countries, this case study focuses on British, Polish, Italian and Dutch debates. However, all the methods described below are done on all languages and the notebooks in the repository offer the opportunity to easily replicate all methods for all languages.

## Parliaments in Pandemic Times

The case study focuses on parliamentary debates. Parliamentary rhetoric serves here as a window onto the (very recent) past. Because contemporary debates are publicized in a machine-readable form by many representative institutions, they can be compared using text analysis methods. Parliamentary debates are, however, highly specific forms of textual data. Compared to other often-used forms of public discourse, parliamentary transcripts stand out for several reasons. Parliamentary interaction, in an ideal-typical setting, is an exchange of arguments *pro* and *contra*. Deviation from this ideal type is part of the day-to-day rhetoric, but in its *argumentative* nature, parliamentary language differs fundamentally from other types of political discourse found in for example social media data or newspapers. It is often future-oriented (in case of new legislation that is being discussed) or reflective (in case of clashes between government and opposition) and, most of all, highly polemical. Another crucial aspect is the fact that parliamentary records are a strange mixture of oratory and written text. Parliamentary speech is usually transcribed. In this process, many of the features distinctive for speech (such as hesitations and the influence of physical context) are removed in order to produce readable text (Mollin, 2007; Cribb & Rochford, 2017). 

The nature of parliamentary language also changes in times of crisis. Political scientists often refer to the so-called "rally around the flag effect" when analyzing crisis politics. Political actors, so the idea runs, "rally" around the flag, temporally suspending the enmities that mark the political landscape. Early studies into the first months of pandemic panic confirm this theory. Trust in governments grew in European countries (Louwerse et al. 2021; Nielsen & Lindvall, 2021). In parliamentary rhetoric, this expectedly reflects into lower levels of discontent, more technical discussions instead of grand ideological clashes and, possibly, a heightened relevance of expertise, as parties rally around expert advice. 

## Approach

The approach taken in this case study starts with basic frequency patterns. Changing frequencies of words reflect their topicality in parliamentary debate. Based on this premise, several quantitative methods are used. Simply counting the occurrences of keywords such as "expert" and "expertise" already points at ruptures in word use. Furthermore, the lexical context of these keywords is used to contextualize the occurrences. I use Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) as a way of investigating which words co-occur often in texts that use expertise-keywords. In this way, we gain a birds-eye view over the debates where expertise was invoked. Furthermore, I use collocation measures to find specific terms the frequently co-occur with expertise-keywords. By using collocation measures to measure relations between groups of words I extent this method to the creation of lexical networks that shed light on the discourse around expertise. The same two-step approach is taken with word embeddings, a technique used to spatially represent the semantic relations of words in a "vector space", based on the assumption that the meaning of a word depends on its context. 

It is important to note that investigating the language of expertise in this case study is not a matter of designing one method that captures all of the relevant signals in the data. Precisely because parliamentary data is so complex and multifaceted, I draw on several well-established methods that each illuminate the topic one step at a time. By combining frequencies, collocations and embeddings I hope to illuminate different aspects of the historical puzzle introduced earlier.

## More Crisis, More Experts? Frequency Patterns

The research departed from the hypothesis that the corona crisis provoked more references to expertise in European parliaments. Frequency patterns quickly disprove this expected general pattern of increasing frequencies. In this section I use a lexicon of terms related to expertise ("expert","science" and "expertise", translated in all participating languages) to inspect frequencies as a first step. Figure X, for example, shows the relative frequencies of the lemma "expert" in eight different countries. Only the patterns in Dutch, Italian, Polish and Spanish suggest change as a result of the corona pandemic (the dashed gray line marks the first week of March 2020 during which infections grew rapidly in many countries).

![Relative Frequencies of 'expert'](https://github.com/rubenros1795/ParlaMintCase/blob/main/results/plots/frequencies/expert-relfreq-gbnldkitczpleslt.png)

Before taking a deep dive into the speeches that mention expertise, it is worthwhile to further investigate other frequency patterns. One way of getting a better idea of national differences and commonalities is investigating the coalition-opposition distribution of the frequency of 'expert'. I plotted the frequency of this term in the first five months of the pandemic (March - July) by coalition and opposition, normalized by the total number of tokens for opposition and coalition (to control for the overall differences in speech size between both groups). The resulting charts shows that there is not common pattern. In Latvia and the Netherlands, the coalition speaks relatively more of experts. In Great Britain, Italy, Czech Republic, Poland and Spain, the opposition speaks more about experts. 

![Relative Frequencies of 'expert' by coalition-opposition](https://github.com/rubenros1795/ParlaMintCase/blob/main/results/plots/frequencies/expert-relfreq-coalition-gbnldkitczpleslt.png)

The divergent patterns in coalition-opposition distributions prompted me to investigate the individual speakers in their uses of "expert". Inspecting the top users of the term shows how in several countries it is the Health Minister (or other members of government in charge of pandemic responses) that utter "expert" the most. James Bethell in Great Britain, Hugo de Jonge in the Netherlands, Aurelijus Veryga in Lithuania and Magnus Heunicke in Denmark use the term the most in their parliaments. In Italy, Poland and Spain, it is the prime minister that occupies the top position. The high rankings of these persons is not surprising. As the crisis unfolded, (prime) ministers drew on experts in their decision-making. However, in multiple countries, opposition figures also use the term frequently. In the Netherlands, the health minister is closely followed by two MPs from the opposition. In Czech Republic two opposition party members occupy the top positions (although we must be careful to draw conclusions from the low frequencies). Similarly, in Spain, Pablo Casado Blanco, leader of the largest opposition party (Partido Popular) closely follows prime minister Pedro Sánchez.

Diving into the speeches themselves shows how especially ministers and coalition members frequently refer to expertise and experts. Often they did so to legitimize policy. Matt Hancock, for example, argued that "we have world-class expertise to make sense of the emerging data" and "Public Health England has world-class expertise in contact-tracing". It also appears that acknowledgement of the role of expert was some kind of shared practice in parliament in the first pandemic months. MPs argued that it "is deeply irresponsible to dismiss expert advice" and praise the "exceptional dedication of our health service workers and medical experts". 

The relatively low frequencies of the top users of "expert", however, hint at something else: a large spread of users. The prime minister of Spain uses 'expert' only 38 times. Because the total number of references is far bigger, a large number of other MPs must have mentioned it. An overview of the distribution of the references over the different speakers is visualized below. The figure shows the number of different speakers that mention 'expert', divided by the monthly total number of different speakers (to compensate for the fact that in some months a high number of different speakers speaks in parliament). Especially the temporal development visible in the figure is interesting. It shows that in Czech Republic, Denmark, Spain, Italy, Lithuania and the Netherlands, the relative number of speakers using 'expertise' increases with the spread of the coronavirus (in the months after February 2020). This means that the lemma "expert" was not only used by prime ministers and health ministers, but also by an increasing number of other MPs. In the case of Spain and the Netherlands this sudden upsurge in topicality halts after April 2020. In other countries the relative number of different speakers mentioning 'expert' also seems to return to pre-covid levels.

## Expertise in Context: TF-IDF Timelines

Since frequency patterns show only a limited picture, the next step in this research is mapping the context "expert(ise)" or "science". Two methods were used to do so. First, I used basic TF-IDF for keyword extraction. This enabled the composition of a timeline with key terms from speeches that mention terms such as "virus" and "pandemic". In this way we can reconstruct the contents of the debates that contain words such as 'expertise'. The timelines show the gradual development of parliamentary language surrounding expertise and COVID.  In the United Kingdom, keywords for February and early March 2020 show how speeches about experts and the virus were about the uncertain search for answers. Words such as "incubation", "transmission" and "contact" point at the uncertainty about the nature of the virus. Later in March, experts are referenced in the context of concrete debates on vaccines ("medicine", "trial", "patient") and policies ("advice", "phase", " system").

## Narratives of Expertise: Collocation Analysis

Frequency patterns only reveal the diachronic patterns in the parliamentary 'lifes' of individual words. Topic modelling on the other hand is a more data-driven type of method that is also not the optimal fit for exploring narratives in which terms surrounding 'expert' were used. However, by leveraging the premise of word co-occurrence that underlies topic modelling (and so many other methods in NLP) we can strike a balance between the not-so-informative individual frequencies and overly general topics. 

Collocation analysis revolves around the co-occurrence of units, in this case words. With information on the (relative) frequency of words and their lexical contexts, several measures can be used to calculate association scores. In this research, ````nltk```` was used to generate bigram collocations. The window size was increased to 15 in order to increase the degree to which the algorithm searches for paradigmatic, instead of syntagmatic relations. If we take a more common window of 5, we get high-ranking word pairs such as "corona" + "virus", "global" + "epidemic" or simply "the" + "virus". By increasing the window, words that are related to the seed term but are not necessarily its direct neighbours are also considered.

The first step in the use of collocations for our case is the aggregation of top collocates for the COVID-period and the reference-period (the year 2019). The table shows how the top ranked collocates differ substantially in the pandemic period. Collocates that are unique compared to the top ranking ones in the reference period (2019-08 - 2020-01) are marked as "(U)". The amount of unique words is quite large, indicating that the discourse on expert(ise) changed intensely during the pandemic. What marks the change is the focus on "guidance" and "advice". In all four languages studied, terms related to this theme are present among the top collocates.

Collocations already point at differences between the two period. However, a more fine-grained perspective would be useful, as attitudes towards and conceptions of expertise are not expected to fall neatly in two periods. Moreover, lists of top ranking collocates do not have that much hermeneutic value. One common way of gaining a more substantive insight into lexical behavior is the production of collocation networks (Brezina, 2018). This method takes the top collocates of a seed term, but also takes the top collocates of those words and the top collocates of those. All in all, this results in a network of *N* <sup>*t*</sup> words, with *N* as the number of top collocates chosen and <sup>*t*</sup> as the number of times the top collocates are taken. This method gives a rough overview of the associations to a seed term and is also able to detect central terms around the seed term if the words are scaled by degree (the number of incoming and outgoing connections). Below are some examples of the collocation networks for the seed term 'expert' in March 2020. In ```/results/plots/collocation-networks``` monthly networks for multiple languages are stored.

The collocation network in March 2020 for Great Britain shows the strong connection between "expert" and "advice", apparently sought in relation to "travel" and "contact" (as well as "constituent"). This strong connection with "advice" continues in April, but the network shows no clear theme in this month. In May 2020, this changes. Expert is now closely related to "face" and "disposal". Collocates to these words suggest the dominance of debates surrounding the supply of face masks.

In Italy, "expert" is connected mostly to tax issues in March 2020. Additionally, we see connections with "organism" and "situation", potentially indicating talk of the virus. In April, more hints at the increased power of expert enters the network through words such as "decision", "task" and "committee". Similar to the UK, more technical discussions involving "expert" ensue in May, indicated by words such as "logistics", "transport", "care worker" and "indicator".

### ## Changing Semantics of Expertise: Embeddings

Collocations are useful for inspecting frequently co-occurring words. However, their capability of mapping semantic change is limited. For this reason I complement the collocation analysis with the use of word embedding models. These models build on the premise of co-occurrence but go further by using co-occurrence as the basis for embedding words in vector spaces. In this way, the semantics of a term are spatially encoded based on its context. Compared to the collocations the hermeneutic power is derived from the fact that the word embedding models come closer to meaning.

Using the well-known ```word2vec``` algorithm (Mikolov et al. 2013) I trained models on data from the COVID period and the reference period (01-01-2019 to 01-02-2020 in order to prevent huge difference in model size). Subsequently, I mapped the top most similar words to expert in Polish, Dutch, Italian and English. 

Many languages show little fundamental change in the semantics of "expert". This is likely to stem from their particular use of the term. In Poland, "ekspert" seems to have more legal connotations, something that does not change significantly based on the most similar terms. In other languages, however, change is visible. The most important way in which "expert" changes according to the embedding models is the new focus on the role of experts. Compared to the reference models, British, Danish and Dutch covid-models include words such as "advice", "steering" and "modelling" that indicate a new focus on the role of experts. Moreover, the type of expert changes in Dutch and British models. Behavioural scientists, virologists and epidemiologists are included in the COVID period, whereas specific roles were lacking in the reference-network or were restricted to economists or more general roles of experts. Another feature that speaks from the table is the inclusion of words related to epistemic virtues in the COVID period. "Eminence", "independence" and "expertise" are stressed more.

## Conclusion

During the COVID-19 pandemic experts enjoyed almost unprecedented prominence in policy- and decision-making. This reflects in parliamentary debates. Although the frequency of the lemma 'expert' does not rise significantly in all countries, some show an increase. Collocations and embeddings further show three types of change: a greater focus on institutional forms of expertise, an emphasis on expert advice and decision and the introduction of virologists and epidemiologists in the associational neighbourhood of 'expert'.
