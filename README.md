# ParlaMint Showcase - Contested Expertise in COVID-19 Parliamentary Debates

## Introduction to the Study
One of the most profound implications of the COVID-19 pandemic is the centrality of scientific knowledge in governmental responses to the crisis. Containment strategies, vaccination efforts and economic policies are not only informed by expertise, but increasingly shaped by it. Medical-scientific experts and institutions have been granted unprecedented legislative and decision-making power. The is an almost one-to-one correspondence between policy and studies by universities and non- or semi-governmental public health institutions (Windholz, 2020; Bertsou, 2020).

The same pandemic, however, gave rise to a broad swath of conspiracy theories, eagerly adopted by populist politicians (Shelton, 2020; Duarte, 2020). The suddenness of the pandemic's spread and the grativity of the containment measures reinforced existing suspicions against scientific and political authorities and fake news has been flourishing online. 

It thus appears that the corona crisis has produced a heightened polarity between the technocratic adoption of scientific knowledge on the one hand, and the conspiratory rejection of (institutionalized) scientific knowledge on the other. For democratic decision-making, this begs the question how to navigate between these poles. This question is relevant because it has proved hard to wage politics during the corona crisis (Amat et al., 2020; Bekker et al., 2020). Political opposition against government strategies has been obscured by a 'rally around the flag'-effect in the first months of the pandemic, and the spectre of conspiratory post-truth soon after.

In order to contextualize and inform this challenge of democratic decision-making in times of post-truth pandemics, this research studies the contestation of and with scientific knowledge in parliamentary debates. It asks to what extent scientific knowledge has been contested, by whom and how political actors used knowledge in their political proposals, or attacked scientific insights used by others.

## Questions
1. How and by whom is scientific knowledge _employed_ in parliamentary debates?
2. How and by whom is scientific knowledge _contested_ in parliamentary debates?
3. To what extent do we see _changes in the politicality_ of scientific knowledge as measured through the interaction between employment and contestation?

## Approach & Method

The research will use both close- and distant-reading methods. Text analysis methods will be used to trace relevant debates and model the relevant indicators (employment, contestation, polarity). 

1. References to Scientific Knowledge & Expertise
    - mentions of specific keywords in debates ('science','expertise')
    - mentions of scientific institutions in debates (NER)
    - mentions of scientific reports in debates (keywords, custom NER?)
    - (mentions of other countries as policy-examples with NER) 
2. Contestation of Scientific Knowledge & Expertise
    - polarity identification of text around keywords (with sent. analysis)
    - diachronic word embeddings for detecting semantic change in keywords
3. Distribution of Scientific Knowledge & Expertise
    - changes in employment of SKE by coalition/opposition
    - patterns in employment at debate-level (interaction)
    - identification of contexts in which SKE is used (topic modelling?)
