# ParlaMint Showcase - Contested Expertise in COVID-19 Parliamentary Debates

This repository contains the code and planning for the ParlaMint showcase. This is a case study related to the [ParlaMint project](https://www.clarin.eu/content/parlamint-towards-comparable-parliamentary-corpora). The case focuses on the role of knowledge and expertise in parliamentary debates during the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Research
The case takes a three-step approach of:
1. aggregating references to scientific knowledge and expertise;
2. mapping the contestation of scientific knowledge and expertise;
3. mapping the differences between their employment across parties and individuals.

By taking this approach we aim to answer the following questions:
1. How and by whom is scientific knowledge employed in parliamentary debates?
2. How and by whom is scientific knowledge contested in parliamentary debates?
3. To what extent do we see changes in the politicality of scientific knowledge as measured through the interaction between employment and contestation?

## Methods
The text analysis is done in Python. In the ```code``` folder, all the scripts can be found. The case is based primarily on established text analysis methods such as frequency analysis, sentiment analysis and word association measures such as PMI.

## Data
The data comes in ```TEI``` xml format. From this, ```.txt``` files are generated that can be easily queried with their associated metadata.
